# Installing
If you don't want to build the project from the source, then you can always find the latest binaries pre-compiled in the [releases](https://github.com/OssieFromDK/DeadByDaylight-Unlocker/releases) tab on github.

# Building
   1. Clone the source with `git clone --recursive https://github.com/OssieFromDK/DeadByDaylight-Unlocker.git`
   2. Open the solution in VS22
   3. Right click the project in the solution explorer (https://i.imgur.com/7Fmne59.png)
   4. Press the `Publish` button and a new page should open
   5. The project comes with a publish profile, so this should be done automatically, but the settings need to be like this if not: (https://i.imgur.com/Grrf1JP.png)
   6. The project will build into a single file which can be found in: `\bin\Release\net6.0-windows\publish`

# Steam players
To use any unlockers on `Steam`, an SSL Pinning Bypass is required. This is because Dead by Daylight has enhanced security against MITM attacks on their Steam servers (*only steam for some weird reason*). We provide an SSL Pinning Bypass [here](https://shoppy.gg/@FortniteBurger)

# Usage
   1. Compile source or <a href="https://github.com/OssieFromDK/DeadByDaylight-Unlocker/releases/latest">download</a> a compiled version.
   2. Open the FortniteBurger.exe file.
   3. Change the platform to the one your using under settings.
   4. Choose which profile to use, and whether to spoof currencies & level.
   5. Go to home page and press launch and the game should automatically begin launching.
